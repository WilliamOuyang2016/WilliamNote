### ML Note
# Book: Building Machine Learning Systems with Python
# The pairs would be your training data, and the resulting rule set (also called model) could then be applied to future e-mails that we have not yet seen. This is machine learning in its simplest form.

Looking at the following typical workflow, we see that most of our time will be spent
in rather mundane tasks:
1. Reading the data and cleaning it.
2. Exploring and understanding the input data.
3. Analyzing how best to present the data to the learning algorithm.
4. Choosing the right model and learning algorithm.
5. Measuring the performance correctly.
