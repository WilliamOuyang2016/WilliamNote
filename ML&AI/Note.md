# Book: Building Machine Learning Systems with Python
# The pairs would be your training data, and the resulting rule set (also called model) could then be applied to future e-mails that we have not yet seen. This is machine learning in its simplest form.

Looking at the following typical workflow, we see that most of our time will be spent
in rather mundane tasks:
1. Reading the data and cleaning it.
2. Exploring and understanding the input data.
3. Analyzing how best to present the data to the learning algorithm.
4. Choosing the right model and learning algorithm.
5. Measuring the performance correctly.

You ask your cousin how he's predicted real estate values in the past. and he says it is just intuition. But more questioning reveals that he's identified price patterns from houses he has seen in the past, and he uses those patterns to make predictions for new houses he is considering.

Machine learning works the same way. We'll start with a model called the Decision Tree. There are fancier models that give more accurate predictions. But decision trees are easy to understand, and they are the basic building block for some of the best models in data science.
